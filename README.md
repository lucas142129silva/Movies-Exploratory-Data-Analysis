In this notebook I made a Exploratory Data Analysis with visualization and Data Manipulation to end up with insights on the Data. Also I did a Machine Learning Predict on the movie revenue. Using concepts like:

● Regression Predict

● Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup

● Image on a Matplotlib graph with opencv

● Data Visualization Technics with Seaborn and Matplotlib

● Data Manipulation with pandas
